# Amiga Exotica Tools ðŸŽ¶

This Python script is a multi-threaded FTP downloader for Amiga music files (`.lha` archives) from the `UnExoticA/Game` directory on `ftp.exotica.org.uk`. It organizes downloads by author into a local `amiga_music_by_author` directory, supports pausing/resuming via a `progress.json` file, and handles connection errors gracefully.
